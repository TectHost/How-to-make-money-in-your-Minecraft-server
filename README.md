# How to make money in your Minecraft Server
### 1 - Why sould I make mony in my server?
You should make money in your server for several reasons, for example it could be the fact that you
maintain the server, i.e. at the very least, you pay for the host, you may also pay for staff, builders,
plugins or mods, etc...
### 2 - Can I monitor my server without violating the EULA?
Yes, but it will be more difficult, as pay to win is not allowed, among other features, but you can
sell anything on your server as long as it does not give a real advantage, that is, for example in
SkyWars and EggWars:

✔️ Can I sell kits or give kits to VIPs

✖ I cannot sell kits or give kits to VIPs that offer an advantage over other players who have not put
money in.

#### ⚠️¡Remember!
In the Survival, SkyBlock, and similar servers is completely forbidden the pay to win and pay to
fast, it is important to know this because many people do not know that the pay to fast is also
prohibited, as well as any object that can not be obtained in vanilla, such as armor protection X
or swords edge X, are also prohibited, It is also forbidden to sell any type of server currency that
can offer an advantage to the player who has them, instead, sell coins that can only be used to buy
things like pets, tags, cosmetics, if it would be allowed, something very common in many survival
is that the VIP have access to the /fly command, this command is also forbidden to sell.

### 3 - Which website can I use to create my online store?

#### 1 – [Tebex/BuyCraft] (https://www.tebex.io/)
This is probably the most used page for Minecraft and other games, it is used by the main Minecraft
servers and that's why we recommend to use Tebex.
Servers using Tebex:
1. [Hypixel] (https://store.hypixel.net/)
2. [CubeCraft] (https://store.cubecraft.net/)
3. [CosmicPVP] (https://buy.cosmicpvp.com/)
#### 2 - [CraftingStore] (https://craftingstore.net/)
This service is recommended for its free plan, since it has more options than Tebex's free plan, the
main functions for which its free plan is better are:
1. Modifying page styling with HTML & CSS
2. Inserting your own domain or subdomain
3. Discord integration
#### 3 - [PlayerLands] (https://playerlands.com/)
This is the least known of the 3 services, but it is still a good option and completely automatic and
free of charge.
### 4 - What can I sell that does not violate the EULA?
You can accept donations, sell ranks (that don't give advantages), sell cosmetics, sell tags, you can
also upload videos to YouTube or make streams on Twitch on their server, so I could get money
and promotion.
Some free plugins that you can use on your server to avoid violating the EULA:
1. [eGlow] (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/eglow-1-9-4-1-19-3-glow-cosmetic-respects-eula-mysql.63295/) (cosmetics)
